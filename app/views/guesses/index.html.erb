<h1>A Quick Puzzle to Test Your Problem Solving</h1>

<p>A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.</p>

<p>Here’s how it works:</p>

<p>We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.</p>

<p>We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.</p>

<ul>
  <% @guesses.each do |guess| %>
    <li>
      <%= guess.first %>, <%= guess.second %>, <%= guess.third %>

      <% if guess.first < guess.second && guess.second < guess.third %>
        Yes!
      <% else %>
        No.
      <% end %>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

    Enter a sequence:

  <input type="text" name="first_number" placeholder="The first number">
  <input type="text" name="second_number" placeholder="The second number">
  <input type="text" name="third_number" placeholder="The third number">
